Whenever I develop a game, I make blocks to signify some equations. So I figured, why not make a collection of these to make my game making easier and to help others with implementing formulas and such on Scratch.

I decided to publish this on Github as people can contribute and fork from my blocks. Feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/68r/myblocks-plus-plus/pulls) if you want to contribute to this project!
